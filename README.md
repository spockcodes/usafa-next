The original code for this scheduling tool was developed by David Caswell and Mark Williams.  The tool schedules a block schedule with 4 periods per day (8 total periods available). It simulateously schedules 3 trimesters in an academic year and provides individual student schedules for the entire year as output.

## Input
- Courses offered by departments
- Cadets enrolled
- Information about intercollegiate sports
- Schedule of when departments will offer courses throughout an academic year and enrollment caps
- Course requests from every student for an academic year.

## Output
- Academic year schedules for individual students


## Version 2
Planned updates to the tool:
- Modify the accepted input to match the exported data formats from USAFA's Campus Solutions tool
- Schedule a single semester at a time 
- 13 periods per block cycle instead of the current 8.
